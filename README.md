## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) - For animation


### What I learned

I learned a great deal while doing this challenge. One I would like to highlight, would be using GSAP for animations. 

I have used GSAP to trigger animations on page load using the React useEffect hook, as well as using GSAP's ScrollTrigger API to trigger animations when a component comes into a users view.

I also learned about NextJS, and the nuances of using the Link component. 

### Continued development

I would like to continue to use GSAP, and learn how to finely control ScrollTrigger animations so that each component reacts independantly, rather than all of the components being animated altogether. Right now, I'm using stagger to make the components look like they're animating when the user scrolls. However, being able to control each independant component would be better. 

Furthermore, I would like to focus on my code organization, particularly with my styled-components. 

### Useful resources

- [GSAP React Docs](https://greensock.com/react/) - This helped me get up to speed with how to use GSAP in a React project.
